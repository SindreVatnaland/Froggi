<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Adding Realtime HUD Elements</h1>

<h2>
	Now we have created elements that occur when a game starts and when pausing. Now we begin adding
	realtime HUD elements.
</h2>

<h2>To start with we can begin with adding percentages and stocks.</h2>

<h2>Create a new layer to layer 3</h2>

<h2>
	Then we can add the <b>Percentage</b>
	element
</h2>

<img
	class="rounded-sm border"
	src="/image/tutorial/new-overlay/select-percent.png"
	alt="Select percent"
/>

<h2>
	Remember to set <b>Visibility condition</b>
	to only be visible when game is not paused, if you want to.
</h2>

<h2>
	The <b>Percent Decimal - Pre animated</b>
	components are special and includes some preset animations, triggers and style only available for
	this component.
</h2>

<h2>
	When the character assigned to the percentage takes damage, this component will animate
	similarly to the original game.
</h2>

<h2>If you want to customize the animations yourself, select the non pre animated component.</h2>
